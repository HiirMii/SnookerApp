# Score Keeper App Project

Third Project for Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree by Google.

The goal was to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.

In order to make it a little bit challenging I decided to create score keeper for a snooker game with eight different scoring posibilities for each player. Each player can score from 1 to 7 points or miss. Miss is used to switch between players.
